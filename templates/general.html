            <div id="why">
              <h2>Why this competition?</h2>
              In the past few years, we’ve seen a lot of new research and creative approaches tackling large-scale ANNS, including:
              <ul>
                <li>partition-based, and graph-based indexing strategies ( as well as hybrid indexing approaches.)</li>
                <li>Mixing RAM and SSD storage to efficiently store and process large datasets that exceed the size of RAM</li>
                <li>Running on accelerator hardware such as GPUs, FPGAs, and other custom in-memory silicon.</li>
                <li>Leveraging machine learning for dimension reduction of the original vectors.</li>
              </ul>
               In addition to an uptick in academic interest, many implementation of these algorithms at scale now appear in production 
               and high availability datacenter contexts: powering enterprise-grade, mission-critical, and web-scale search applications.
                In these deployment scenarios, benchmarks such as cost, preprocessing time, power consumption become just as important as
                the accuracy-vs-latency tradeoff. Despite this, most empirical evaluations of algorithms have focused on smaller datasets
                of about a million points, e.g. ann-bechmarks.com. However, deploying recent algorithmic advances in ANNS techniques for
                search, recommendation and ranking at scale require support at billion or substantially larger scale. Barring a few recent
                papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale.
                
                We believe that this challenge will be impactful in several ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>Provides a comparative understanding of algorithmic ideas and their application at scale.</li>
                  <li>Promotes the development of new techniques for the problem and demonstration of their value.</li>
                  <li>Provides a compilation of datasets, many new, to enable future development of algorithms.</li>
                  <li>Introduces of a standard benchmarking approach.</li>
                </ul>
                By providing a platform for the parties interested in this problem, we aim to en result in more collaboration and collectively advance the field at a more rapid pace.

              <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
                Watch this space for official registration, finalized datasets, and competition rules. We expect registration in May. <BR>
                Rough Timeline (subject to change):
                <ul>
                  <li>Mid To Late May : release of data, guidelines, rules, and a call for participation. The competition registration web site goes on-line.</li>
                  <li>Mid-June: Code and testing infrastructure released. Participants in need of compute resources will be required to submit an expression of interest.</li>
                  <li>Early July: Allocation of compute resources and start of the competition timeline.</li>
                  <li>October: End of competition period and submission of code and report.</li>
                  <li>Early November: Review of code by organizers and participants. Release of preliminary results on standardized machines.</li>
                  <li>Early To Mid November: Participants can raise concerns about the evaluation.</li>
                  <li>Early December: Final results published, and competitive results archived (the competition will go on if interest continues).</li>
                </ul>
                During NeurIPS Organizers overview the competition and results. Organizers also request the best entries
                (including leaderboard toppers, or promising new approaches) to present an overview followed by discussion.

            <div id="tracks">
              <h2>Tracks</h2>
              There are two standard standard hardware tracks in which the trade-off between recall and throughput will be evaluated. 
              <ul>
                <li>T1: DRAM is constrained to 64GB for search and 128GB for build.</li>
                <li>T2: In addition to the limited DRAM in T1, the machine will have also 2TB SSD storage. </li>
              </ul>
              Participants are expected to release their code for index building and search which the organizers will run and time. Index building must complete in a limited time (to be specified).
              
              For the Custom Hardware track (T3), the participants can use non-standard hardware such as GPUs, AI accelerators, FPGAs, and custom in-memory silicon. 
              In this track, participants will either 1) send their hardware (such as PCI boards) to GSI technology at their expense, 
              or 2) if that is not possible, we will make scripts available so that those participants can run the evaluation themselves. 
              In the T3 track, we will collect the following benchmarks:
              <ul>
                <li>Search Recall vs throughput</li>
                <li>Index build time</li>
                <li>Cost and power ( measured as queries/second/watt and MSRP/watt )</li>
              </ul>
               We will ask the participant to provide details and proof of the custom hardware’s cost in the form of manufactured suggested retail price (MSRP).

               We will provide the exact details on how we collect and compute these benchmarks as well as additional machine and operating system specification before the competition begins.
