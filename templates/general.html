            <div id="why">
              <h2>Why this competition?</h2>
              In the past few years, we’ve seen a lot of new research and creative approaches tackling large-scale ANNS, including:
              <ul>
                <li>partition-based, and graph-based indexing strategies ( as well as hybrid indexing approaches.)</li>
                <li>Mixing RAM and SSD storage to efficiently store and process large datasets that exceed the size of RAM</li>
                <li>Running on accelerator hardware such as GPUs, FPGAs, and other custom in-memory silicon.</li>
                <li>Leveraging machine learning for dimension reduction of the original vectors.</li>
              </ul>
               In addition to an uptick in academic interest, many implementation of these algorithms at scale now appear in production 
               and high availability datacenter contexts: powering enterprise-grade, mission-critical, and web-scale search applications.
                In these deployment scenarios, benchmarks such as cost, preprocessing time, power consumption become just as important as
                the accuracy-vs-latency tradeoff. Despite this, most empirical evaluations of algorithms have focused on smaller datasets
                of about a million points, e.g. ann-bechmarks.com. However, deploying recent algorithmic advances in ANNS techniques for
                search, recommendation and ranking at scale require support at billion or substantially larger scale. Barring a few recent
                papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale.
                
                We believe that this challenge will be impactful in several ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>Provides a comparative understanding of algorithmic ideas and their application at scale.</li>
                  <li>Promotes the development of new techniques for the problem and demonstration of their value.</li>
                  <li>Provides a compilation of datasets, many new, to enable future development of algorithms.</li>
                  <li>Introduces of a standard benchmarking approach.</li>
                </ul>
                By providing a platform for the parties interested in this problem, we aim to en result in more collaboration and collectively advance the field at a more rapid pace.

            <div id="tracks">
              <h2>Tracks</h2>
              <p>There are two standard standard hardware tracks in which the trade-off between recall and throughput will be evaluated. 
              <ul>
                <li>(T1) In-memory indices with <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss" target="_blank">FAISS</a> as the baseline. DRAM is constrained to 64GB for search and 128GB for build. </li>
                <li>(T2) Out-of-core indices  with <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/diskann" target="_blank">DiskANN</a> as the baseline. In addition to the limited DRAM in T1, the machine will have also 1TB SSD storage for search and 3TB storage for build.</li>
              </ul>
              Participants are expected to release their code for index building and search which the organizers will run and time. Index building must complete in a limited time (to be specified).
              </p>
              <p>
              For the Custom Hardware track (T3), the participants can use non-standard hardware such as GPUs, AI accelerators, FPGAs, and custom in-memory silicon. 
              In this track, participants will either 1) send their hardware (such as PCI boards) to GSI technology at their expense, 
              or 2) if that is not possible, we will make scripts available so that those participants can run the evaluation themselves. 
              In the T3 track, we will collect the following benchmarks:
              <ul>
                <li>Search Recall vs throughput</li>
                <li>Index build time</li>
                <li>Cost and power ( measured as queries/second/watt and MSRP/watt )</li>
              </ul>
               We will ask the participant to provide details and proof of the custom hardware’s cost in the form of manufactured suggested retail price (MSRP).
              </p>
               We will provide the exact details on how we collect and compute these benchmarks as well as additional machine and operating system specification before the competition begins.
